    <p style="font-family:'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif ;font-size:20px;text-align: justify;">Essay on Digital Marketing: Digital marketing is when any product is promoted through a minimum of one form of electronic media. This form of marketing is vastly different from traditional marketing. Digital marketing consists of various methods and channels that allow any organization or company to have and study this form of marketing to find out what works for them and what does not.

        The core of this sort of marketing is the internet. The internet, as it is, is a potent tool to help us achieve a lot. It helps in marketing as well as it assists sellers in promoting their products across the across. Advertisements on various forms of social media and other sites, emails, and YouTube can be used by organizations to sell their products.Digital marketing is, as the word suggests, the use of digital media to market products. There are multiple websites like Amazon, Myntra, Flipkart, etc., where people can buy products. This applies to products such as clothes, technical tools, groceries, medicines, food, and so much more. So much so that one doesn’t have to leave the house if one doesn’t want to.

        The challenge is for the right information of the right products to reach the right customer. This is where digital marketing comes in. Through data mining, it is easy for marketers to target the right audience with the right advertisement of products that they might need. This is what makes digital marketing successful more than anything. Finding and targeting the right audience can increase sales drastically. Some tools can be used to analyze and suggest better options for marketing as well. This helps sellers market their products.Digital Marketing can be seen as a new philosophy and business practice emerging with improvements in technology. Goods, services, and even ideas and information can be marketed using the internet today. Traditional marketing still exists, but it may slowly begin to dissolve for a majority of the market in the coming decades. Digital marketing makes shopping easier for the consumer. If a seller knows what his target audience wants, it makes marketing so much more easier.

        This is exactly how digital marketing helps. It gives you to analyze what worked where, for who, and how much. So that, the next time, they can target a more specific audience.
        
        Digital marketing often works in the form of advertisements or any other form of promotion. Promotions of products these days are not just limited to ads. Affordability: If a company or an organization wants to invest money in marketing and advertising a product or service, they will not invest in newspapers, televisions, and such, as much as they would in online advertising. For one, the latter is a lot cheaper than the former and vastly cost-effective.

        At lower prices, a wider audience can be captured. And not just any audience, a very targeted audience that increases the sales.
        
        Better ROI (Return On Investment): Digital marketing has the ability as well as the potential to provide returns on investments.
