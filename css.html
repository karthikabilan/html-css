  <h1><span> kl rahul (indian cricketer-right handed batsman,wicket keeper)</span></h1>
  <p style="background-color:black;color:white;height: 200px;width:350px">This hundred gave Rahul some momentum, and he went on to make hundreds indies on away tours, making the opening combination a dilemma for the Indian selectors. He showed his tendency to convert starts, making his first three fifty-plus scores count, and going on to score a hundred each time. However, he continued to have anxious starts and got the reputation of an 'all-or-nothing' player.
